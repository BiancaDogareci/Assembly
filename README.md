#Developed an x86 assembly project handling directed graphs, enabling input of adjacency lists to generate adjacency matrices. Extended functionality to calculate the number of paths of a specific given length between specified nodes, enhancing skills in low-level programming and graph theory.

##Project requirement 1:
- input of adjacency lists
- generate adjacency matrices

##Project requirement 2:
- calculate the number of paths of a specific given length between specified nodes

##Input:
<br>
1    // project requirement number
<br>
4    // number of nodes
<br>
2    // node 0 is adjacent to two nodes (nodes 1 and 2) 
<br>
2    // node 1 is adjacent to two nodes (nodes 2 and 3)
<br>
1    // node 2 is adjencent to one node (node 3)
<br>
0    // node 3 is adjencent to no nodes
<br>
1    // nodes which node 0
<br>
2    // is adjencent to

2    // nodes which node 1
<br>
3    // is adjencent to
<br>
3    // node which node 2 is adjencent to
